This folder contains a bunch of scripts to ease compilation of my modified version of OpenSAND


To compile opensand from the source code : 

0) Make sure that you have copied the opensand.tar.gz archive (that contains the source) in this folder, 
   as well as the "install_scripts" folder.
   
1) Run the compilation script : 
./cleanAndRecompileAll.sh


TROUBLESHOOTING

IF Opensand-Core COMPILATION FAILS (error saying someting like <function> is not defined in Conf) : 
=> Purge open sand from your system by running : 
cd purgeOpenSand
./removeAndPurgeOpenSand.sh

=> Do the partial compilation of opensand (will compile and install opensand Optput, Conf, and RT
./doPartialCompilation.sh

=> Finally, do the compilation and packaging
./buildAndInstallAll.sh


A cleanAndRecompileAll.sh script is provided which does this whole purging opensand/compilation/copy of packages process.
