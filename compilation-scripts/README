This folder contains a bunch of scripts to ease compilation of my modified version of OpenSAND


To install opensand from the source code : 

0) Make sure that you have copied the opensand.tar.gz archive (that contains the source) in this folder, 
   as well as the "install_scripts" folder.
   You should a deploy_locally_shared_folder.sh script.

1) Run the deploy_locally_shared_folder.sh script via source.
   It will copy all the files and put you in a temporary folder.
   To do so : 

source ./deploy_locally_shared_folder.sh

2) (from the temporary install folder, ie "/tmp/opensand_installer_dir") :
   Run the installer.
   It will install the required libraries, compile all open-sand sources and install them.
   To so so, simply type : 

./buildAndInstallAll.sh


The installer will call a bunch of scripts that will install all opensand modules one by one.
If any step fails, the installer will stop and should notify you which operation failed.

3) That's it. OpenSand should now be installed on your VM / Computer



TROUBLESHOOTING

IF Opensand-Core COMPILATION FAILS (error saying someting like <function> is not defined in Conf) : 
=> Purge open sand from your system by running : 
cd purgeOpenSand
./removeAndPurgeOpenSand.sh

=> Do the partial compilation of opensand (will compile and install opensand Optput, Conf, and RT
./doPartialCompilation.sh

=> Finally, do the compilation and packaging
./buildAndInstallAll.sh


A cleanAndRecompileAll.sh script is provided which does this whole purging opensand/compilation/copy of packages process.
